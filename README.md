##  Week 1

Few words from the heart.

> This is a warm-up week and for some of you the, so we'll take 
> it easy on you. All you have to do is to prepare your computing environment. 
> If you have never worked with Python, this is a good chance for you to 
> start - you'll be using it a lot during this semester (or not, if you prefer C++).
> We have prepared a few simple tasks that you can find in the directory 
> "week_1" - Jupyter Notebook. If you know all of that already, well 
> than, congratulations ;)
> 
> But still... the attendance of the seminars is mandatory.

> Regards, Lukas.
